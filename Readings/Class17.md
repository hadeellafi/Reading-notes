# Testing, Swagger, and Deployment

## Swagger

Swagger is a language-agnostic specification for REST APIs, enabling both humans and computers to understand their capabilities without direct access to the source code.

### Swagger UI

Swagger UI offers a web-based interface that provides detailed information about the service and allows testing of each public action method in your controllers.

## Testing Controllers

As we have learned before, unit tests are used to test blocks of code, and the same principle applies to unit testing controller logic. In unit testing for controllers, only the contents of a single action are tested.

## Deployment

Deployment is the process of releasing and making application available for use in a particular environment.

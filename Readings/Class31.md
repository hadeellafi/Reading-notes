# Razor Pages

This topic is important because Razor Pages can simplify coding for page-focused scenarios, making it easier and more productive compared to using controllers and views.

## Application Structure

Razor Pages, while having a structure similar to MVC, do not have separate controller and view folders. Instead, the Pages folder contains Razor views, which are similar to MVC views but include code.

## MVC vs Razor Pages

**ASP.NET MVC**:

- Utilizes the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture.

**Razor Pages**:

- Razor Pages consolidate both the action and the view model into a single class, connecting this class to the view, which is referred to as a Razor Page.

## Topic: Debugging &try/catch blocks

### What is the Debugging?

Debugging means running your code step by step in a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to find the exact point where is a programming mistake. It is a crucial skill as it helps identify and resolve programming mistakes and errors. By using debugging techniques, we can step through our code, track the execution flow, and pinpoint the exact location of issues. This ability to identify and fix bugs is essential in ensuring the correctness and efficiency of our programs.

#### Some ofÂ  the core principles of debugging:

- Clarify the problem by asking yourself the right questions: Before starting the debugging process, it's important to clearly identify the problem or issue we are trying to solve. This involves asking the right questions and gaining a thorough understanding of the expected behavior and the actual behavior of the code.

- Examine your assumptions: Debugging requires us to challenge our assumptions about the code and its expected outcomes. By examining our assumptions, we can uncover any misconceptions or faulty expectations that might have led to the bug.

### How should try/catch blocks be used?

In coding, try/catch blocks are used to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of the code. The code statements that might raise exceptions are placed within a try block, and the statements to handle those exceptions are placed within catch blocks. Each catch block specifies the type of exception it can handle and includes additional statements for handling that specific exception. This allows us to gracefully handle exceptions and provide appropriate error-handling mechanisms.

# Object Oriented Principles

## Inheritance

Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class.

## Abstract

An abstract class cannot be instantiated. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects:

1. At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places.
2. Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation.

## Object-oriented

C# is an object-oriented programming language. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:

1. Abstraction Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.
2. Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
3. Inheritance Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.
4. Polymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.

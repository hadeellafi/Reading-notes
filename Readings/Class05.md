# Class05:Linked lists

## Why do we use a linked list?

Linked lists offer several advantages over other data structures. The biggest advantage is their dynamic nature, allowing adding and removing elements at any position within the list. Usually, linked lists are used when the size of the data collection is not known in advance.

## What is the linked list?

A linked list is a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list. There are different types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.

## How do we use it?

Linked lists are created by instantiating a head node, which serves as the starting point of the list. To add elements to the linked list, new nodes are created and linked to the existing nodes using their reference pointers.

Overall, linked lists are valuable data structures for scenarios where flexibility, efficient element insertion and deletion, and dynamic resizing are important. By understanding linked lists, we can effectively utilize them in various programming tasks.

# Intro to MVC

 This topic matters because it provides a structured approach to designing and developing applications, offering benefits such as maintainability, scalability, modularity, and improved collaboration.

## Azure Dev Ops

Azure DevOps supports a collaborative culture among developers, project managers, and contributors, enabling faster product creation and improvement compared to traditional software development methods.

## MVC Basics

MVC is a design pattern which helps in developing the web application in a most efficient way.

### Differences between ASP.NET Web Application Framework and ASP.NET MVC Application Framework

- ASP.NET web application approach combines user action and view, while MVC views only handle page UI, with user actions defined in Controller.

- ASP.NET Web Application is a View based architecture while MVC is action-based architecture.

- ASP.NET uses View State for web page state maintenance, causing heavy load and inefficient server trips. MVC doesn't have this, resulting in low response time and a user-friendly experience.

- MVC improves test-driven development by separating Models, Controllers, and Views into separate layers, allowing for easier testing of the UI and action logic.

### MVC Architecture

**Model** layer represent the objects in the Application.

**View** Layer has all the html controls which define the UI of the application.

**Controller** handles the request from user.

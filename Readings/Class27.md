# MVC Forms

## View Models

the view handles the app's data presentation and user interaction.Razor markup is code that interacts with HTML markup to produce a webpage that's sent to the client.

- layouts

Use layouts to provide consistent webpage sections and reduce code repetition. Layouts often contain the header, navigation and menu elements, and the footer.

- partial views
  - Reduce the duplication of common markup content across markup files.
  - Break up large markup files into smaller components.

- View components
appropriate for view content that requires code to run on the server in order to render the webpage.

### Benefits of using views

- Views are generally grouped by app feature.
- The parts of the app are loosely coupled.
- build and update the app's views separately from the business logic and data access components.
- modify the views of the app without necessarily having to update other parts of the app.
- easier to test the user interface parts of the app .

### View discovery

View discovery is a process where an action returns a view, determining which view file is used based on the view name. The default behavior is to return the same view as the action method.

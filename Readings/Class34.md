# Payment Processing

Understanding payment processing matters because it directly impacts the financial operations and customer experience of online businesses.

## How Does Online Credit Card Processing Work?

### Merchant Accounts

A Merchant Account is used to process credit card transactions online. It accepts or denies credit cards and deposits money into the bank account.

### Payment Gateway

The Payment Gateway is responsible for sending the credit card to the appropriate Internet Merchant Account over secure online channels.

### Your Application

Your application interacts with the Payment Gateway in two ways.

- Simple applications redirect users to the Gateway's page for processing.
- Sophisticated applications control credit card entry and send the data to the Gateway via an API.

the process:

1. User enters credit card info into the application.
2. Info is sent to the Payment Gateway via a secure channel.
3. The Gateway routes the credit card to the Internet Merchant Account.
4. The Merchant Account processes the credit card.
5. The result is passed back to the Gateway and then the application.

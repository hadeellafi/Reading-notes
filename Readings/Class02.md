## Unit Testing and Documentation

## Unit Testing

1. Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity
    - Catching Bugs Early:identify bugs and errors in their code much earlier in the development cycle.
    - Improving Code Quality:ensuring that each unit of code is functioning correctly and as expected.
    - Frequent Releases:can quickly identify and fix issues

2. How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry?

    Assuming that the function responsible for the task is written, to create the test cases I will:

- Define specific test cases that cover different aspects of putting away laundry
- Review or rework: Review the test cases Consider factors such as clarity of instructions, and alignment with the desired outcome.
- Execute test cases

## Documentation

 1. Name 3 reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code.
    - Clarity and understanding:  README that provides clear explanations of the project's purpose and functionality side will make it easier for users to go through the project, explore and understand the code.
    - Project maintenance: the README helps maintenance of the project because it has important information such as the project's known issues, and planned future work and by keeping this information up to date, it will help both current and future developers understand the project's status.
    - No README? No abstraction: No README means developers will need to delve into your code in order to understand it.
 2. When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include.

- Name
- Usage
- Installation
- License

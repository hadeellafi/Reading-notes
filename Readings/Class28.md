# Authentication, Authorization, and Cookies

This topic is matter because Cookies allow us to store information about a visitor and retrieve it in subsequent requests. This is a critical strategy utilized in various scenarios, such as maintaining user sessions, tracking their website usage, and personalizing their experience.

Using HTTP Cookies
An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent by a server to a user's web browser. It is used to identify whether two requests originate from the same browser and to store stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

Cookies primarily serve three purposes:

1. Session Management
   - Session cookies are automatically deleted when the current session ends.

2. Personalization
   - Cookies can store user preferences and personalize their experience.

3. Tracking
   - Cookies enable tracking user behavior and usage patterns on a website.

Defining the Lifetime of a Cookie
Cookies can have different lifetimes:

- Session cookies: These are deleted when the current session ends.
- Permanent cookies: They are deleted on a specified date set by the Expires attribute.

Restricting Access to Cookies
To ensure the security of cookies and prevent them from being accessed by unauthorized parties or scripts, two attributes are commonly used:

- Secure Attribute: This attribute ensures that cookies are transmitted securely over HTTPS.
- HttpOnly Attribute: It prevents cookies from being accessed through client-side scripts, enhancing security.

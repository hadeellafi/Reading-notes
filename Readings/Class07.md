# Interface in 'C#'

An interface in C# serves as a blueprint of a class, defining a set of related behaviors that classes must implement. It resembles an abstract class, with all methods declared inside the interface being abstract, lacking a method body. Interfaces cannot be instantiated and do not declare instance data like fields. Interface names conventionally begin with the letter "I".

**Multiple Interface Implementation** : One of the notable advantages of interfaces is the ability for a class to implement multiple interfaces. This feature enables the class to inherit and provide implementations for the members defined in each interface it implements. By supporting multiple interface implementation, classes gain the flexibility to exhibit diverse behaviors defined by different interfaces. This capability enhances code flexibility and promotes the reuse of common functionality.

# Trees

trees are hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes.

## Properties of Tree Data Structure

- **Number of edges**
- **Depth of a node**: length of the path from the root to that node.
- **Height of a node**: length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.
- **Height of the Tree**: the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.
- **Degree of a Node**: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. 

### Traversals

it is how to move through trees is a key component of trees.two categories of traversals :

- Depth First
- Breadth First

#### Depth First

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

#### Breadth First

iterates through the tree by going node-by-node through each level.

### Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

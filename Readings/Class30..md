# Hash Tables

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every `Bucket` has both a key, and a value.

## What is a Hashtable?

**Hash** is an algorithm that converts an incoming string into a value , typically used to determine the array's index.

**Buckets** are the elements within each index of a hashtable array, which can potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

**Collisions** occur when multiple keys are hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Why do we use them?

- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

## Methods

**set()**  used to add a new piece of information in the hashtable.

**get()**  helps to find something we've put in the hashtable.

**has()**  tells if something is inside the hashtable is exist or not.

**keys()**  gives a list of all the names (keys) of the things we've put in the hashtable.

**hash()** - turns names (keys) into numbers. The same name always turns into the same number, it helps to know where to put things in the hashtable.

## Class 01
Reflecting on Today's Learning
Today's learning session was focused on methods, exception handling, and debugging in C#. 

---

## Methods in C#
I already had a basic understanding of methods, but today I gained a deeper understanding of how to write and use them in c#.

---

## Exception Handling
I learned about different types of exceptions, such as format, out-of-range, and divide-by-zero exceptions. Exception handling allows us to gracefully handle errors and prevent our programs from crashing. I now have a better understanding of how to use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide appropriate error messages to the user.

---

## Debugging Techniques
 I searched about types of breakpoints, which helped me pause the program's execution at specific points and examine the values of variables. Conditional breakpoints were particularly useful as they allowed me to specify conditions for when the program should pause, making the debugging process more targeted and efficient.

## Areas for Further Learning
While I made progress in understanding methods, exception handling, and debugging, there are still some details I want to explore further. One area of interest is understanding when to use static methods versus instance methods in different programming scenarios. I also want to delve deeper into more advanced exception handling techniques and explore common best practices.

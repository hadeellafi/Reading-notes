### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Break the problem into smaller tasks: Divide it into manageable tasks and focus on solving one component at a time. 
2. Google it: search if there is someone stuck in the same problem and if there are any suggestions to solve it.
3. Take a break : usually, I step away from the problem for a while by taking a break or moving to another task and get back with a clear mind that helps me to approach the problem from a new angle.

4. Ask for help: Reach out to colleagues, or online communities for assistance.

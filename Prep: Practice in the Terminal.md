## Prep: Practice in the Terminal

- Linux is described as an extensionless system, meaning that file extensions are not essential for determining file types. The system looks inside the file to identify its type. The file command is mentioned as a tool to determine the type of a file.
- The case sensitivity of Linux is highlighted, emphasizing that files and directories with the same name but different letter cases are considered distinct.
- The manual pages are described as a set of pages that explain every command available on the system, including their descriptions, usage, and command line arguments.
The syntax for invoking the manual pages is shown as man <command>.
- A specific example of using the man command with the ls command is provided, demonstrating the structure of a manual page.
The breakdown of the ls manual page is explained, highlighting the command's name, synopsis (overview of how to run the command), description, and the list of available command line options.
- To create folder: mkdir [options] <Directory>
- Removing or deleting a directory :rmdir [options] <Directory>.
